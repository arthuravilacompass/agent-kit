# Kit governance

Canonical doc for the agent-kit artifact lifecycle. `README.md`, `unwired/README.md`, and `using-agent-kit` point here. History and dates live in `CHANGELOG.md`; the always-on byte ceiling is measured by `scripts/check-ceiling.sh`.

## The 3-state model (D10)

Every artifact that has ever existed in this kit is in one of these three states, never in limbo:

- **wired** — lives in `plugins/<plugin>/` (today: `core`, `council`, `team`, `mobile`). Admitted because it has proven real use (not just "seemed good"). Costs context in every session that loads the plugin.
- **unwired** — lives in `unwired/`. Genericizable, mechanical scrub applied, but no proof of use in the new project. Context cost **zero** — only read if someone opens the file.
- **deleted** — does not exist in the repo. Evaluated and discarded (vestigial, too specific to the origin project to genericize, or replaced by something better).

Never "tested but not wired" — that phantom third category is exactly what this model exists to eliminate.

## Promotion rule

**An item moves up from `unwired/` to `plugins/` (wired) when it has proven real use in the new project — the same admission bar any new skill/agent/hook would have, no exception for something merely advisory or reminder-only.** Not "seems useful" nor "was used in the origin project" — it's: you invoked it at least once in the new project, it worked, and you want it to survive the next `/clear`.

When promoting:

1. **Rewrite the `description`** with the trigger specific to the new context — the archived description carries the origin project's vocabulary/trigger (sometimes already generic, sometimes not).
2. **Fill in the provenance placeholders** (`<TICKET>`, `<DesignTokens>`, `<BOARD_NAME>`, component names inside `<>`) with the new project's real names. The scrub that put the item in `unwired/` was mechanical, not a rewrite — re-anchoring it in the new domain is your job, not this kit's.
3. **Move the file** to `plugins/<plugin>/` in the standard layout (skills under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, agents under `agents/<name>.md`, etc.) and run `claude plugin validate .`.
4. **Delete the copy in `unwired/`** — a promoted item doesn't stay duplicated in both states.

Historically, a few items were promoted under rotation-deadline pressure before proven real use — logged with immediate adversarial review of the diff in `CHANGELOG.md`; that path isn't machine-tracked in this doc anymore.

## External unvendored skills

Not every tool this kit's methodology relies on lives inside `plugins/`. Some are adopted as-is from the external Claude Code ecosystem — installed globally (`~/.claude/skills/`, via `npx skills add <repo>`), not vendored, not tracked by `INVENTORY.md` (which only covers this repo's own plugin manifests). They sit outside the wired/unwired/deleted model above entirely — that model is for artifacts that live in this repo.

Adopted after hands-on testing on real artifacts, not source-reading alone — evaluation notes live in the maintainer's local session memory, not in this repo:

- **`writing-fragments` / `writing-shape` / `writing-beats`** (from `mattpocock/skills`) — 2-phase explore/exploit writing discipline for turning session raw material into a structured guide/article. `disable-model-invocation: true` in all three — zero always-on cost.
- **`walkthrough`** (from `alexanderop/walkthrough`) — generates a self-contained interactive HTML walkthrough (clickable Mermaid + per-node detail) for explaining a flow/architecture/schema. Model-invoked — always-on cost accepted deliberately.
- **`mermaid-skill`** (from `Agents365-ai/mermaid-skill`) — generates `.mmd` diagrams exported to PNG/SVG. Model-invoked, aggressive auto-trigger description — always-on cost accepted deliberately (low-commitment keep: has a known unresolved subgraph-title clipping bug, `walkthrough` covers the richer "explain this to someone" case, but this one stays for plain diagram-in-a-markdown-doc use).

If one of these earns real, repeated use and the operator wants it to survive an environment reset with edit rights, port it into `plugins/` following the same attribution convention as `core:orchestrate`/`grill-me` (in-body blockquote + `metadata` frontmatter) — that's the point it would actually enter the wired/unwired model above.

## Skill vs. standalone tool

A skill has stopped being a skill and should become a standalone tool (invoked by a thin skill) when it accumulates **2 or more** of:

- **(a) its own executable scripts with their own test suite** — not one helper script, a suite with selftests.
- **(b) a dominant fraction of the plugin's files** — the skill outweighs the plugin it's supposed to be one skill within.
- **(c) its own runtime** — dependencies beyond the language stdlib, a venv, or external binaries the method shells out to.

**Verdict**: `apk-archaeology` met all three before this change — 41 of the `mobile` plugin's 79 files (~52%), 10 selftests, external binaries (`jadx`/`apktool`/`adb`). Extracted to `tools/apk-archaeology/`; the skill remains in `plugins/mobile/skills/apk-archaeology/` as a thin conductor that invokes it.

## Meta-principle

**A textual rule that keeps failing becomes a mechanism.** Under a finite attention budget, marginal instructions get omitted, not disobeyed — stacking more text reduces aggregate compliance, it doesn't just stop improving it. The rule with the highest failure rate becomes a hook, a mandatory output schema, or a deterministic gate — not more text.

## Always-on tier ceiling

The `core` always-on tier — the body of `using-agent-kit` injected per session via `plugins/core/hooks/session-start.sh` — has a ceiling of **16,384 bytes**, measured on the hook's actual output (full JSON; a conservative proxy for the injected payload, envelope and escaping included).

- **Enforcement**: `scripts/check-ceiling.sh` in the gate — red if the measurement goes over the ceiling.
- **Intended effect**: selection pressure. A new rule in the always-on tier competes for space; when the ceiling tightens, something has to go (becomes an on-demand skill, a mechanism, or gets deleted) — the ceiling doesn't rise for convenience. Raising the ceiling is a governance decision.

## What each plugin is

Identity across the kit's 4 plugins — the coherence test for a new skill: if it doesn't fit any sentence below, it doesn't enter any plugin.

- **`core`** — delivery methodology with deterministic enforcement, ticket to PR, any stack.
- **`council`** — epistemic lenses for high-reversal-cost decisions.
- **`team`** — agile-ceremony copilot (PO refinement, squad communication).
- **`mobile`** — Flutter/Dart toolkit.

`mobile` is the flagship by admission criterion, not by raw volume: it's the vertical the kit's bar for "earns a place" is calibrated against, but of the kit's 33 skills only 11 are Flutter-specific — the other 22 (`core`/`council`/`team`) are stack-agnostic.

## Architecture — 3 layers

| Layer | What it does | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Epistemic** | Always-on rules + deterministic gates that don't depend on the model obeying: provenance, `mobile`'s blocking smell-checker, the always-on byte ceiling, plus advisory hooks (codegen-staleness, lifecycle/dispose, DI-mismatch — full list in [INVENTORY.md](../INVENTORY.md)). Council's reasoning postures sit alongside for the judgment calls a gate can't make. | `core` (rules + gates), `mobile` (verifiers), `council` (postures) |
| **2. Workflow conduction** | `core:pipeline` detects the real stage and conducts stage-to-stage; `superpowers` (or your own method) executes. | `core:pipeline`, optional `superpowers` |
| **3. Verticals** | `mobile` is the flagship: Flutter/Dart review, scaffolding, and the deterministic checks above, calibrated against a real stack. `team` is the secondary vertical (agile ceremonies). | `mobile`, `team` |

## Posture

Deterministic where determinism is possible; agnostic where it isn't. The gates in layer 1 are mechanically verifiable — run them, get a pass/fail, no interpretation required. The broader claim — that any of this improves model behavior in general — is untested; what's real and checked is narrower: the mechanism either fires or it doesn't.

## Conventions

- **Language**: skill/doc bodies in English; runtime output (Council callouts, review findings, `grill-me`, etc.) mirrors the user's language, default English — deterministic scripts/gates always emit English.
- **Slash-only**: `disable-model-invocation: true` when the cost of a wrong trigger is high — an effect hard to reverse, a high orchestration cost, or a long ceremony that shouldn't start on the model's own initiative.
- **No provenance narration in a shipped body**: a skill/agent/hook doesn't narrate its own history ("Promoted from `unwired/`", origin-project notes) — that lives in git and `CHANGELOG.md`, not in something loaded every session. `check-ceiling.sh`'s grep for "Promoted from" is only the mechanizable half of this rule; the rest is reviewer judgment.

## Decisions worth remembering

- **D6** — Council episodic corpus: `outcome` is stored and displayed, never enters scoring/ranking — the corpus records "cases that happened"; interpretation is the reader's. Cited in `plugins/council/skills/council-recall/SKILL.md`.
